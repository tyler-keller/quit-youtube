# quit-youtube

this is my site for quitting youtube.

i find that youtube is a catch-22:
- there is content which provides alpha
- there is content that is just time-waste

the goal for this service is to provide like-minded individuals w/ all the tools to take full advantage of youtube w/o the bad parts.

currently supports:
- append `quit` to any youtube.com/watch url and return the embeded video
- introduction content on the mission of the site

want to support:
- google oauth
- time-waste visualization service
- `alpha` creator feed
